I was doing this project with a tutorial and repository pattern, because I wanted to expand my knowledge in building more advanced APIs. I didn't completely rely on the tutorial though, I've done most things on my own. I also didn't put much effort in the front-end I was mainly focused on the backend side.

Time spent: 47 hours
